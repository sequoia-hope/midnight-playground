# Decisions the spec did not cover

Choices made while executing the roadmap, where SPEC.md and ROADMAP.md were
silent. Each one took the option that best preserves parity (ROADMAP working
rule 4). The owner can overturn any of them; add a line saying so.

Format: number, date, work package, the decision, why.

## D1. Hash maps are banned outright in the simulation crates

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. SPEC 3.2 forbids hash-map *iteration* in `mr_math`,
`mr_track`, `mr_levels` and `mr_sim`. `check-deps` forbids the types
(`HashMap`, `HashSet`) instead: a source scan cannot tell lookup from
iteration, and SPEC 4.2 wants JS insertion order, which a vector of pairs or
an index-keyed array gives and a hash map never does.

## D2. `check-deps` also scans for platform float functions

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. SPEC 4.2 says the simulation and world generation never
call `f64::sin` and friends. `check-deps` enforces it by scanning the
sources of `mr_math`, `mr_track`, `mr_levels`, `mr_sim`, `mr_worldgen` (and
the kernel's wasm crate) for `x.sin(`, `f64::sin(` and the like: every
inexact function, plus `powi` (not the same rounding as `Math.pow`) and
`mul_add` (fuses a rounding away). Comments are skipped. `mr_canvas`,
`mr_audio` and `mr_game` are not scanned: their output is compared with
tolerances, not bit for bit.

## D3. Banned crates are checked on the default feature set for every target

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. `cargo tree --target all -e normal` with default
features. For world generation, `rayon` appearing there means it is not
behind a non-default feature, which is what SPEC 3.2 requires. The
simulation crates additionally ban `getrandom`, `rand*`, `rayon*`,
`crossbeam*`, `js-sys` and `wasm-bindgen*`, which carry ambient randomness,
threads or the browser.

## D4. The web build profile

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. `cargo xtask web --release` builds the `web-release`
profile (fat LTO, one codegen unit, `panic = "abort"`) and runs
`wasm-opt -Oz`. SPEC 11 allows size optimisation where a benchmark shows no
frame-time cost; there are no frames to time until M2, so WP 2.6 revisits
`-Oz` against `-O3`. The Rust toolchain follows stable (`rust-toolchain.toml`)
rather than a pinned version: the results the port compares are fixed by
`libm` and IEEE arithmetic, not by the compiler. The `wasm-bindgen` crate is
pinned exactly (`=0.2.129`), because its CLI must match.

## D5. The WP 0.1 page reports WebGPU and secure context

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. The bare wasm page prints whether `navigator.gpu` exists
and whether the page is a secure context, so opening it on a candidate
reference phone over the tailnet already answers the first question of G1.

## D6. The kernel includes `log10`

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. SPEC 4.2 lists thirteen functions as the full set the
game and three.js use. three.js's `BufferGeometryUtils.mergeVertices` also
calls `Math.log10`, and world generation calls `mergeVertices` (desert props
and parts, valley flora), so a kernel-on world build would have thrown.
`log10` joins the kernel. The functions that throw when the kernel is on are
the remaining inexact ones: `sinh`, `cosh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`,
`cbrt`, `expm1`, `log1p`.

## D7. The kernel's `pow` and `hypot` follow ECMAScript at their edges

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. C's `pow(1, NaN)` and `pow(-1, ±inf)` are 1; JS's are
NaN. C's `hypot` is left to `libm`, but the kernel spells out JS's rule (any
infinity gives +Infinity, else any NaN gives NaN) rather than rely on it.
Otherwise the kernel-on reference could take a branch the live game does not.

## D8. The kernel's wasm is committed

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. `tools/parity/kernel/mr_kernel.wasm` (20 KB) is in git,
so the JS oracle runs, and `npm run test:unit:kernel` passes, without a Rust
build, and the `js-reference` tag carries the exact kernel its goldens were
taken with. `cargo xtask kernel` rebuilds it and checks a million inputs per
function against native Rust; CI runs `cargo xtask kernel --check`, which
checks both a fresh build and the committed file and writes nothing. The
check hashes outputs with every NaN taken as the canonical quiet NaN, since
wasm does not fix NaN payloads (a NaN in the simulation is a bug either way).

## D9. How the hooks are switched on

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. URL parameters, read by `src/parity/hooks.js`, the first
module `main.js` imports, so the kernel is in place before any other module
computes at load time (it fetches the wasm synchronously for that reason):
`kernel=1`, `fixeddt=1` (with `ticks=N` per frame, default 2), `quant=1`,
`seed=N`, or `parity=1` for all of them with seed 1. In fixed-dt mode the
input layer is also read once per tick and the frame's game time is the ticks
run, so everything (camera, effects, scenery) follows game time, not the
clock. The e2e harness adds `MR_QUERY` to every page, so the whole suite runs
with any hook on (`MR_QUERY=kernel=1 npm run test:e2e`).

## D10. Generator parameters default to `Math.random`, one per stream

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. `AIDriver` takes `opts.rng`, `PoliceDriver` a fourth
argument `rng`, `Pursuit` a `policeRng` beside its existing `rng`, and
`PursuitView` passes `rng` and `policeRng` through; `Race` takes `rngs`
(`{ ai, police, pursuit }`, from `simStreams(seed)` in `src/parity/sim.js`).
Every default is `Math.random`, including `policeRng` when only `rng` is
given (the unit tests pass a seeded `rng` to `Pursuit` and leave the police
weave on `Math.random`, as before). The streams count their draws, so a
trace can record where each one is.

## D11. Input quantisation

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. `quantiseInput` (`src/parity/sim.js`) turns the steer
into `Math.round(clamp(steer, -1, 1) * 32767) / 32767` and throttle and brake
into `Math.round(clamp(x, 0, 1) * 255) / 255`; `handbrake`, `nitro` and
`analog` become booleans. The Rust `InputFrame` stores the integers and
divides the same way, so both sides integrate identical values. It applies
to the input from the player's devices or the autopilot, after the
autopilot, not to the controls the race itself produces (the cool-down
driver after the finish, the penalty hold).

## WP 0.7 decisions

## D40. Math.random in the audio is one seeded stream

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. The audio code draws from `Math.random` for the noise
beds, the tunnel's impulse response, loop start offsets, pops, misfires,
one-shot variations, radio takes and the burble. Every audio capture
replaces it with `mulberry32(1)` (the algorithm of `src/util/math.js`)
before `GameAudio` is built; nothing else draws from it there. So the
Rust `mr_audio` takes one random stream and draws from it exactly where
and in the order the JS calls `Math.random`; in the parity tests it is
`mulberry32(1)`. With that, the Node fake and Chrome build bit-identical
buffers (the renders stage checks it).

## D41. The call log is a facade log played back on a virtual clock

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. A Web Audio call log taken in the browser is not
reproducible: `currentTime` runs on the audio clock, and the music
scheduler, the gate tails and the radio's decode-or-burble race run on
`setTimeout`. So the capture has two halves. In Chrome, the real game
(`?parity=1`, autopilot) logs only the calls it makes on its audio facade,
tagged with the race tick; that log is identical run to run. In Node, the
log is played back into `GameAudio` on a recording Web Audio fake whose
clock is game time (tick k is at k/120 s), with `setTimeout` on that clock
and decoding standing in for Chrome's (`parity/golden/audio/README.md`
has the rules). The Web Audio call log is a pure function of the facade
log. M5 plays the same facade log into `mr_audio` with the null backend
under the same rules and compares the two call logs; this tests what the
web backend will send to the browser, which is what SPEC 7.5 asks of it.

## D42. AudioParam.value reads evaluate the automation timeline

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. The game reads `param.value` twice (`shift` and
`setPursuitMood`) and schedules from it. The fake, and so the null backend,
returns the param's automation timeline evaluated at `currentTime` (Web
Audio 1.0 rules: the value setter is `setValueAtTime(v, now)`, ramps run
from the previous event, a target curve from the value at its start),
rounded to float32 as Chrome stores params. A ramp straight after a target
curve starts from the target's start value (the spec's literal reading);
the game never reads a param in that state.

## D43. Audio arrays at 48 kHz, the big ones by hash

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. The arrays are generated at 48 kHz, the rate desktops
and iPhones run. All of them come to 12 MB and noise does not compress, so
`parity/golden/audio/arrays.json` commits each array's hash and stats and
`arrays-small.bin` the ones up to 16384 floats (every engine wave and
curve, the short kit voices); the whole set is in the cache, which the
`arrays` stage rebuilds in about a second. SPEC 7.3's 1e-5 tolerance for
`samples.js` is applied against the cached arrays.

## D44. Offline renders are compared by band level; Chrome's floor measured

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. Chrome's offline renders are not bit-reproducible:
connections summing into one input are mixed in an order that changes
between runs (differences near 1e-7), and where that reaches an
oscillator's frequency through audio-rate modulation it accumulates in the
phase (up to about 1e-3 on the engine). The reference therefore records
third-octave band levels (`tools/parity/lib/bands.mjs`, one analyser for
both sides), renders each scenario twice and records the larger band
difference as `jitter` (at most 0.21 dB; 0.38 dB between two separate
runs, all on the engines). `--check` accepts 1.0 dB per band and ignores
bands quieter than -90 dB; SPEC 7.5's 1.5 dB for the Rust comparison stays,
since it is about four times Chrome's own floor.

## D45. Render control frames are 8 ms, not a tick

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. An OfflineAudioContext can only suspend on a
128-sample render quantum, and 1/120 s is 400 samples at 48 kHz. The
renders steer the audio every 384 samples (8 ms, three quanta) with
`update(0.008, state)`, and pump the music every 64 frames a second ahead,
as `tools/audio-test.html` does.

## D46. The one `**` in the audio is `x * x`

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. `pulseWave` squares with `Math.cos(...) ** 2`. The
operator does not go through the kernel. V8's `x ** 2` equals `x * x` on a
million random inputs and on every input `pulseWave` gives it, so the port
writes `x * x`. No audio path calls a function the kernel leaves out
(`sinh`, `cbrt`, `expm1`, ...): every capture ran with the kernel on and
nothing threw.

## D47. Radio clips are decoded by Chrome once, then stood in for

2026-10-03, WP 0.7. The Node playback cannot decode MP3. Chrome decodes
every clip in `audio/radio/` at 48 kHz once (`radio-clips.json`: hash,
channels, length); in the playback `decodeAudioData` resolves at once with
a buffer of that length, so a radio line's clips always beat its 700 ms
burble fallback (the game prefetches them at race start, so they do in
practice too). The clip samples are not part of the reference: both ports
decode the same files.
