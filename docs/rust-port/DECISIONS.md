# Decisions the spec did not cover

Choices made while executing the roadmap, where SPEC.md and ROADMAP.md were
silent. Each one took the option that best preserves parity (ROADMAP working
rule 4). The owner can overturn any of them; add a line saying so.

Format: number, date, work package, the decision, why.

## D1. Hash maps are banned outright in the simulation crates

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. SPEC 3.2 forbids hash-map *iteration* in `mr_math`,
`mr_track`, `mr_levels` and `mr_sim`. `check-deps` forbids the types
(`HashMap`, `HashSet`) instead: a source scan cannot tell lookup from
iteration, and SPEC 4.2 wants JS insertion order, which a vector of pairs or
an index-keyed array gives and a hash map never does.

## D2. `check-deps` also scans for platform float functions

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. SPEC 4.2 says the simulation and world generation never
call `f64::sin` and friends. `check-deps` enforces it by scanning the
sources of `mr_math`, `mr_track`, `mr_levels`, `mr_sim`, `mr_worldgen` (and
the kernel's wasm crate) for `x.sin(`, `f64::sin(` and the like: every
inexact function, plus `powi` (not the same rounding as `Math.pow`) and
`mul_add` (fuses a rounding away). Comments are skipped. `mr_canvas`,
`mr_audio` and `mr_game` are not scanned: their output is compared with
tolerances, not bit for bit.

## D3. Banned crates are checked on the default feature set for every target

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. `cargo tree --target all -e normal` with default
features. For world generation, `rayon` appearing there means it is not
behind a non-default feature, which is what SPEC 3.2 requires. The
simulation crates additionally ban `getrandom`, `rand*`, `rayon*`,
`crossbeam*`, `js-sys` and `wasm-bindgen*`, which carry ambient randomness,
threads or the browser.

## D4. The web build profile

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. `cargo xtask web --release` builds the `web-release`
profile (fat LTO, one codegen unit, `panic = "abort"`) and runs
`wasm-opt -Oz`. SPEC 11 allows size optimisation where a benchmark shows no
frame-time cost; there are no frames to time until M2, so WP 2.6 revisits
`-Oz` against `-O3`. The Rust toolchain follows stable (`rust-toolchain.toml`)
rather than a pinned version: the results the port compares are fixed by
`libm` and IEEE arithmetic, not by the compiler. The `wasm-bindgen` crate is
pinned exactly (`=0.2.129`), because its CLI must match.

## D5. The WP 0.1 page reports WebGPU and secure context

2026-10-03, WP 0.1. The bare wasm page prints whether `navigator.gpu` exists
and whether the page is a secure context, so opening it on a candidate
reference phone over the tailnet already answers the first question of G1.

## D6. The kernel includes `log10`

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. SPEC 4.2 lists thirteen functions as the full set the
game and three.js use. three.js's `BufferGeometryUtils.mergeVertices` also
calls `Math.log10`, and world generation calls `mergeVertices` (desert props
and parts, valley flora), so a kernel-on world build would have thrown.
`log10` joins the kernel. The functions that throw when the kernel is on are
the remaining inexact ones: `sinh`, `cosh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`,
`cbrt`, `expm1`, `log1p`.

## D7. The kernel's `pow` and `hypot` follow ECMAScript at their edges

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. C's `pow(1, NaN)` and `pow(-1, ±inf)` are 1; JS's are
NaN. C's `hypot` is left to `libm`, but the kernel spells out JS's rule (any
infinity gives +Infinity, else any NaN gives NaN) rather than rely on it.
Otherwise the kernel-on reference could take a branch the live game does not.

## D8. The kernel's wasm is committed

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. `tools/parity/kernel/mr_kernel.wasm` (20 KB) is in git,
so the JS oracle runs, and `npm run test:unit:kernel` passes, without a Rust
build, and the `js-reference` tag carries the exact kernel its goldens were
taken with. `cargo xtask kernel` rebuilds it and checks a million inputs per
function against native Rust; CI runs `cargo xtask kernel --check`, which
checks both a fresh build and the committed file and writes nothing. The
check hashes outputs with every NaN taken as the canonical quiet NaN, since
wasm does not fix NaN payloads (a NaN in the simulation is a bug either way).

## D9. How the hooks are switched on

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. URL parameters, read by `src/parity/hooks.js`, the first
module `main.js` imports, so the kernel is in place before any other module
computes at load time (it fetches the wasm synchronously for that reason):
`kernel=1`, `fixeddt=1` (with `ticks=N` per frame, default 2), `quant=1`,
`seed=N`, or `parity=1` for all of them with seed 1. In fixed-dt mode the
input layer is also read once per tick and the frame's game time is the ticks
run, so everything (camera, effects, scenery) follows game time, not the
clock. The e2e harness adds `MR_QUERY` to every page, so the whole suite runs
with any hook on (`MR_QUERY=kernel=1 npm run test:e2e`).

## D10. Generator parameters default to `Math.random`, one per stream

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. `AIDriver` takes `opts.rng`, `PoliceDriver` a fourth
argument `rng`, `Pursuit` a `policeRng` beside its existing `rng`, and
`PursuitView` passes `rng` and `policeRng` through; `Race` takes `rngs`
(`{ ai, police, pursuit }`, from `simStreams(seed)` in `src/parity/sim.js`).
Every default is `Math.random`, including `policeRng` when only `rng` is
given (the unit tests pass a seeded `rng` to `Pursuit` and leave the police
weave on `Math.random`, as before). The streams count their draws, so a
trace can record where each one is.

## D11. Input quantisation

2026-10-03, WP 0.3. `quantiseInput` (`src/parity/sim.js`) turns the steer
into `Math.round(clamp(steer, -1, 1) * 32767) / 32767` and throttle and brake
into `Math.round(clamp(x, 0, 1) * 255) / 255`; `handbrake`, `nitro` and
`analog` become booleans. The Rust `InputFrame` stores the integers and
divides the same way, so both sides integrate identical values. It applies
to the input from the player's devices or the autopilot, after the
autopilot, not to the controls the race itself produces (the cool-down
driver after the finish, the penalty hold).
